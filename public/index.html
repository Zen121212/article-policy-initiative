                 <p>Trade is a useful barometer of economic vitality, as it is indicative of an economy’s competitiveness
                    and societal preferences. Countries that develop their industrial and agricultural base export more
                    products than countries that are less developed, with some going one step further by fostering an
                    environment in which complex products can be produced and exported. As exports rise, countries
                    can import more products that they do not produce domestically. By examining a country’s imports
                    and exports, one can begin to understand more about its economy, business environment,
                    consumer habits, and official trade policies.
                    Bearing these assumptions in mind, The Policy Initiative gathered and analyzed trade data to
                    determine what it reveals about the current state of the Lebanese economy. As a merchant republic,
                    Lebanon has maintained policies supportive of the free exchange of goods and capital since its
                    founding. While the total value of Lebanese exports in recent years remained relatively low, about
                    $4 billion, import bills expanded to reach $20 billion. In effect, Lebanon was living beyond its means
                    and not generating enough dollars from exports to buy imported products. Instead of curbing
                    imports or promoting exports, policymakers chose to attract capital from abroad to finance the
                    difference and maintain an abnormal standard of living. Ensuing trade deficits and the budget
                    deficits were the main causes of the 2019 financial collapse. Over the last four years, Lebanon’s GPD
                    contracted to less than half of its 2018 level. The Lebanese pound lost more than 95% of its value, the
                    commercial banking sector is effectively bankrupt, poverty soared, and income and wealth
                    inequalities reached unprecedented levels.
                    This study aims to assess how trade has been affected by the economic and financial crisis.
                    Generally, when a currency collapses, exports increase as products become relatively cheaper to sell
                    abroad and imports decrease as they become more expensive. In most cases, as a trade deficit
                    shrinks, demand for hard currency reduces. Accordingly, TPI chose to closely examine the effect of
                    the financial and economic crisis on the value of both imports and exports between 2018 and 2022.
                    Going beyond the aggregate numbers, we determine the composition of exports, not solely in
                    terms of sectors and sub-sectors, but also how and to what extent products with comparative
                    advantage have changed. We also focus on how complex products – which require a higher level of
                    sophistication to make – evolved during this period. While product diversification is important, our
                    work examines Lebanese export markets as well as the potential to export more products that are in
                    demand worldwide. We also examine Lebanon’s import basket and assess how the types
                    of goods in it, including basics and luxury products, have changed over the same period.

                    <p>Trade is a useful barometer of economic vitality, as it is indicative of an economy’s competitiveness
                    and societal preferences. Countries that develop their industrial and agricultural base export more
                    products than countries that are less developed, with some going one step further by fostering an
                    environment in which complex products can be produced and exported. As exports rise, countries
                    can import more products that they do not produce domestically. By examining a country’s imports
                    and exports, one can begin to understand more about its economy, business environment,
                    consumer habits, and official trade policies.
                    Bearing these assumptions in mind, The Policy Initiative gathered and analyzed trade data to
                    determine what it reveals about the current state of the Lebanese economy. As a merchant republic,
                    Lebanon has maintained policies supportive of the free exchange of goods and capital since its
                    founding. While the total value of Lebanese exports in recent years remained relatively low, about
                    $4 billion, import bills expanded to reach $20 billion. In effect, Lebanon was living beyond its means
                    and not generating enough dollars from exports to buy imported products. Instead of curbing
                    imports or promoting exports, policymakers chose to attract capital from abroad to finance the
                    difference and maintain an abnormal standard of living. Ensuing trade deficits and the budget
                    deficits were the main causes of the 2019 financial collapse. Over the last four years, Lebanon’s GPD
                    contracted to less than half of its 2018 level. The Lebanese pound lost more than 95% of its value, the
                    commercial banking sector is effectively bankrupt, poverty soared, and income and wealth
                    inequalities reached unprecedented levels.
                    This study aims to assess how trade has been affected by the economic and financial crisis.
                    Generally, when a currency collapses, exports increase as products become relatively cheaper to sell
                    abroad and imports decrease as they become more expensive. In most cases, as a trade deficit
                    shrinks, demand for hard currency reduces. Accordingly, TPI chose to closely examine the effect of
                    the financial and economic crisis on the value of both imports and exports between 2018 and 2022.
                    Going beyond the aggregate numbers, we determine the composition of exports, not solely in
                    terms of sectors and sub-sectors, but also how and to what extent products with comparative
                    advantage have changed. We also focus on how complex products – which require a higher level of
                    sophistication to make – evolved during this period. While product diversification is important, our
                    work examines Lebanese export markets as well as the potential to export more products that are in
                    demand worldwide. We also examine Lebanon’s import basket and assess how the types
                    of goods in it, including basics and luxury products, have changed over the same period.
